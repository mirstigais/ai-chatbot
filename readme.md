# AI chatbot thingy for course
---
**Setup:**
Rename .env.example to .env (in case of changing the model, also swap it in a-comply-modelfile)
Docker compose up. (might take a while)
Create knowledge base from rag-documents. (Yet to automate that) 
When chatting use ai-comply-chatbot.

Proudly vibe configured with zero braincells used.
